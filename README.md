# blockchat
a blockchain comment thread

This is mostly an experiment and a way to learn more about Solidity, Truffle and web3js. 
The end goal is a contract that can be deployed to create a new comment thread, and an embeddable HTML / JS frontend,
enabling blockchain-powered comments on blog posts, etc.
